# Introduction {#intro}
I have started writing this book in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, having figured out that it has been more than 10 years since the publishing of the fundamental textbook of [@Hyndman2008b], who discuss ETS (Error-Trend-Seasonality) framework in the Single Source of Error (SSOE) form. If you are interested in knowing more about exponential smoothing, then this is a must read material on the topic. However, there has been some progress in the area since 2008, and I have developed some models and functions based on ETS, making the framework a bit more flexible and general. Given that the publication of all the aspects of these models in peer-reviewed journals is difficult and challenging, I have decided to summarise all the progress in the book, showing what happens inside the models and how to use the functions in different cases.

Before we move to nitty gritty details of the models, it is important to agree what we are talking about. So, here is a couple of definitions:

- **Statistical model** (or 'stochastic model', or just 'model' in this textbook) is a 'mathematical representation of a real phenomenon with a complete specification of distribution and parameters' [@Svetunkov2017a]. Very roughly, the statistical model is something that contains a structure (defined by its parameters) and a noise that follows some distribution.
- **True model** is the idealistic statistical model that is correctly specified (has all the necessary components in correct form), applied to the data in population. By this definition, true model is never reachable in reality, but it is achievable in theory if for some reason we know what components and variables should definitely be in the model and have all the data in the world.
- **Estimated model** (aka 'used model' or 'applied model') is the statistical model that was constructed and estimated on the available sample of data. This typically differs from the true model, because the latter is not known. Even if the specification of the true model is known for some reason, the parameters of the estimated model will differ from the true parameters due to sampling randomness.
- **Data generating process** (DGP) is an artificial statistical model, showing how the data could be generated in theory. This notion is utopic and can be used in simulation experiments in order to check, how the selected model with the specific estimator behave in a specific setting. In real life, the data is not generated from any process, but is usually based on complex interactions between different agents in a dynamic environment. Note that I make a distinction between DGP and true model, because I do not think that the idea of something being generated using a mathematical formula is helpful. Many statisticians will not agree with me on this distinction.
- **Forecasting method** is a mathematical procedure that generates point and / or interval forecasts, with or without a statistical model [@Svetunkov2017a]. Very roughly, forecasting method is just a way of producing forecasts that does not explain how the components of time series interact with each other. It might be needed in order to filter out the noise and extrapolate the structure.

Later in this book, we will see several examples of statistical models, forecasting methods, DGPs and other notions.

Note that this textbook assumes that the reader is familiar with introductory statistics and knows basic forecasting principles. [@Hyndman2018] can be a good start if you do not know either. We will also use elements of linear algebra to explain some modelling parts, but this will not be the main focus of the textbook and you will be able to skip the more challenging parts without jeopardising the main understanding of the topic.


## Forecasting process and forecasts evaluation {#forecastingProcess}
Before we move to the discussion of models and their estimation it makes sense to discuss the forecasting process and how the forecasts should be evaluated. We should start by saying that forecasting needs to be done for a specific purpose. It should not be done just because you can do that. Forecasts should be useful for specific decisions. And these decisions dictate what forecasts and on what horizons to do.

```{example, name="Example"}
Retailers typically need to order some amount of milk that they will sell over the next week. They do not know, how much they will sell, so they usually order, hoping to satisfy, let us say, 95% of demand. This situation tells us that the forecasts need to be done for a week ahead, they should be cumulative (considering the overal demand during a week before the next order) and that they should focus on an upper bound of a 95% prediction interval. Producing just point forecasts might not be useful in this situation.
```

When you understand how your system works and what sort of forecasts you should produce, then you can start an evaluation process, measuring the performance of several forecasting models / methods and selecting the most appropriate for your data. There are different ways how the performance of models / methods can be measured and compared.

### Measuring accuracy of point forecasts {#errorMeasures}
We start with a situation, when point forecasts are of the main interest. In this case we typically start by splitting the available data into train and test sets, and apply the models under consideration to the first one, producing the forecasts for the second, not showing that part to the model. This is called "fixed origin" approach: we fix the point in time, from which to produce forecasts, we produce them, calculate some sort of error measures and compare the models.
