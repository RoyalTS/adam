# ADAM ARIMA {#ADAMARIMA}
Another important dynamic element in ADAM is ARIMA model [developed originally by @Box1976]. ARIMA stands for "AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average", although the name does not tell much on its own and needs additional explanation, which will be provided in the next sections. The main idea of the model is that the data might have dynamic relations over time, where the new values depend on the values on the previous observations. This becomes more obvious in case of engineering systems and modelling phisical processes. For example, @Box1976 give an example of a series of CO$_2$ output of a furnace, when the input gas rate changes. In this case, the elements of ARIMA process are natural, as the CO$_2$ cannot just drop to zero, when the gas is switched off - it will leave the furnace, in reducing quantity over time (i.e. leaving $\phi_1\times100\%$ of CO$_2$ in the next minute, where $\phi_1$ is a parameter in the model). Another example, where AR processes are natural is the temperature in the room, measured with 5 minutes intervals. In this case the temperature at 5:30pm will depend on the one at 5:25pm (if the temperature outside the room is lower, then it will go down slightly due to the loss of heat). So, in these examples, ARIMA model can be considered as a [true model](#intro), but when it comes to time series from the social or business domain, it becomes very difficult to motivate the usage of ARIMA from the from the modelling point of view. For example, the demand on products does not reproduce itself and in real live does not depend on the demand on previous observations, unless we are talking about a repetitive purchases by the same group of consumers. So, if we construct ARIMA for such process, we are closing eyes on the fact that the observed time series relations in the data are most probably spurious. At best, ARIMA in this case can be considered as a very crude approximation of a complex true process (demand is typically influenced by price changes, consumer behaviour and promotional activities). So, whenever we work with ARIMA models in social or business domain, we should keep in mind that they are wrong even from the philosophical point of view. Nevertheless, they still can be useful, which is why we discuss them in this chapter.


## Introduction to ARIMA
We will explain the main idea of ARIMA in several steps.
### AR(p) {#ADAMAR}
We start with a simple AR(1) model, which is written as:
\begin{equation}
  {y}_{t} = \phi_1 y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t ,
  (\#eq:ADAMARIMA100Example)
\end{equation}
where $\phi_1$ is the parameter of the model. This formula tells us that the value on the previous observation is carried out to the new one in the proportion of $\phi_1$. Typically, the parameter $\phi_1$ is restricted with the region (-1, 1), in order to make the model stationary, but very often in real life $\phi_1$ actually lies in (0, 1) region. The forecast trajectory of this process would typically correspond to the exponentially declining curve. Here is a simple example in R of a very basic forecast from AR(1) with $\phi_1=0.9$:
```{r}
x <- vector("numeric", 20)
x[1] <- 100
phi <- 0.9
for(i in 2:20){
    x[i] <- phi * x[i-1]
}
plot(x, type="l", xlab="horizon")
```

If for some reason we get $\phi_1>1$, then the trajectory becomes explosive, corresponding to exponential increase, implying non-stationary behaviour. The model in this case becomes very difficult to work with even if the parameters is close to one. So it is typically advised to restrict the parameter with stationarity region (we will discuss this later in this chapter).

In general, it is possible to imagine the situation, when the value at the moment of time $t$ would depend on several previous values, so the model AR(p) can be written as:
\begin{equation}
  {y}_{t} = \phi_1 y_{t-1} + \phi_2 y_{t-2} + \dots + \phi_p y_{t-p} + \epsilon_t ,
  (\#eq:ADAMARIMAp00Example)
\end{equation}
where $\phi_i$ is the parameters for the $i$-th lag of the model. So, the model assumes that the data on the recent observations is influenced by the $p$ previous observations.
